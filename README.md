# Bing-Rewards-Automator
Automates the accumulation of bing points! (hopefully)
By Daniel Goldberg 2021 (9145824788 for questions)

Takes a txt file called email3.txt that contains a list of bing account emails. One email per row. no empty rows.

BingRewards Automated will logonto each account and search until it reaches max daily searches. for isntance if you can earn 50 points today by searching, it will search 10 times.

BingRewards Automated (with quizes) does the same as the other program, except it also does the quizes that are available. Uh at least i hope it does lol. Its a work in progress, and would require a lot of monitoring and updating over time. IMPORTANT:  i havnt tested it with bing Polls yet, so idk if those work. will fix soon. IMPORTANT: WATCH IT RUN THE FIRST ACCOUNT, if it opens a quiz, waits a second, closes out of it without taking it, and the program prints "getting featured link" (but it was a quiz), then that means that there is a new type of quiz or something that i have not coded for. It'll skip it i hope. I will have to program it to be able to take that quiz tho.

That being said, for both programs, a lot of the code here is dependent on certain xpath designations and assumptions about how the site works. If Bing changes something, the program might not be able to complete, and needs to be changed. 


thanks!


FURTHER INFORMATION:
do not touch the txt file called ThisOrThat.txt. its just a data storage for answers to ThisorThat questions. it wipes itself each day. It stores answers incase you have multiple accounts you want to run. This way it knows the right answers for when it takes the quiz on the second account.

ye boiiii.
